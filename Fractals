I was recently asked  to design a porous sphere, and I thought it would be a 
great opportunity explore mathematicals concepts I hadn't used much (or at all)
in 3D modeling. I scripted two different solutions. 

On the left, I intersected a sphere with the triply periodic minimal surface. 
On the right, I used fractals. Fractals are often used to represent elements in nature, trees, 
dandelions, the respiratory system etc...
